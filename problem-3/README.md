# useEffect

This project demonstrates the use of the `useEffect` hook in React for handling side effects such as fetching data, subscribing to events, and updating the document title.

## Components

1. **FetchData**: Fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder API and displays it.
2. **MouseTracker**: Tracks mouse movement and displays the coordinates.
3. **TitleUpdater**: Updates the document title based on a counter value.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Learnings

- How to handle side effects in React using `useEffect`.
- Cleanup functions in `useEffect` to prevent memory leaks.
- Dependencies array in `useEffect` to control when the effect runs.
